Greetings people of the future!

This application is a Unity Game that can be played by opening the Level1House Scene in the scenes folder. 
	Open up the "Build Folder Open This First" folder and select the "cryptid game jam" file.
		-Note: You will need a working Windows 10 Operating system and Unity version 2019.2.18. 
		-Final note: This is not the final version of the game. I was in the middle of working on this right when the files were copied to that strange mine, so bear with me.
Enjoy the experience.
