Greetings people of the future!
If you're reading this, I'm dead, my family's dead, my children's dead, and their chidren's dead. 
This application is a Unity Game that can be played by opening the Level1House Scene in the scenes folder. 
	-Opening up the scene, you should next click on the arrow button on the top of the screen to start playing it.
		-Note: You will need a working Windows 10 Operating system and Unity version 2019.2.18. 
		-Final note: This is not the final version of the game. I was in the middle of working on this right when the files were copied to that strange mine, so bear with me.
Enjoy the experience.
